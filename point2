	- the model is robust inaaccurate initial labels
	- outperform binary & multilabel segemntation
- future work
	- deep learning--> It enables using highly reliable object prior for interactive image segmentation 
	- can be applied to solve other semi-supervised computer vision and graphics problems that need to handle inaccurate initial supervision : 
		- interactive video segmentation
